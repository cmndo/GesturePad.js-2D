# JavaScript Gesture Engine #
## A port from previous langagues ##
I first ported this from ActionScript to JavaScript for use in an Appcelerator Titanium iPhone Application but used their custom touch api. I'm in the process of refactoring it to work in the browser and on the mobile web.

## What needs done ##
Nothing. Use it.

Examples need made
